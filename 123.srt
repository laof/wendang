今天我们要读一读小原则

00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,950
第一章
Chapter ONE

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,730
一次是在我六岁的时候
Once when i was six years old

6
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,110
我在一片嘘声中看到了一张宏伟的画面
I saw a magnificent picture in a boo

7
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,740
来自 natur 的真实故事
Called true stories from natur

8
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,610
关于原初邪恶森林
About the prime evil forest

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,440
那是一条蟒蛇的照片
It was a picture of a boa constricto

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,897
吞食动物的行为
In the act of swallowing an animal

11
00:00:55,897 --> 00:00:59,370
这是图纸的副本
Here IS A COPY OF THE DRAWING

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,220
在嘘声中
In the boo

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:08,550
它说：蟒蛇吞下他们的猎物 whol
It said : boa constrictors swallow their prey whol

14
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,175
无需咀嚼
Without chewing it

15
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:15,190
之后他们就不能移动了
After that they are not able to move

16
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,710
他们睡过消化所需的六个月
And they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion

17
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,305
我沉思着
I pondered deepl

18
00:01:25,305 --> 00:01:29,500
然后穿越丛林的冒险
Then over the adventures of the jungle

19
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,870
在用彩色铅笔工作一番之后
And after some work with a colored pencil

20
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,732
我成功地画了我的第一幅画
I SUCCEEDED IN MAKING MY FIRST DRAWING

21
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,540
我的第一名
My join number one

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,860
它看起来像这样
It looked like this

23
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,680
我向大人们展示了我的杰作
I showed my masterpiece to the grown ups

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,980
并问他们这幅画是否吓到了他们
And asked them whether the drawing frightened them

25
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,370
但他们害怕地回答
But they answered frightened

26
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,420
为什么有人应该被帽子吓到
Why SHOULD ANYONE BE FRIGHTENED BY A HAT

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,115
我的画不是一顶帽子的图片
My drawing was not a picture of a hat

28
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:17,620
那是一张蟒蛇消化大象的照片
It WAS A PICTURE OF A BOA CONSTRICTOR DIGESTING AN ELEPHANT

29
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,550
但是由于大人们无法理解它
But since the grown ups were not able to understand it

30
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,660
我又画了一幅画
I made another drawing

31
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,660
我画了 BOA 构造器的内部
I DREW THE INSIDE OF THE BOA CONSTRUCTOR

32
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,720
这样大人们才能看得清楚
So that the grown ups could see it clearly

33
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,420
他们总是需要解释事情
They always need to have things explained

34
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,640
我的第二幅画是这样的
My drawing number two looked like this

35
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,480
这次大人们的反应是劝我
The grown ups response this time was to advise m

36
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,725
放下我对蟒蛇的画作
To lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors

37
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:04,495
无论是从内部还是从外部
Whether from the inside or the outside

38
00:03:04,495 --> 00:03:08,840
转而致力于地理
And devote myself instead to geography

39
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,337
历史、算术和语法
History , arithmetic and grammar

40
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:17,250
这就是为什么在六岁时
That is why at the age of six

41
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,760
我放弃了本来可能辉煌的画家生涯
I give up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter

42
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,940
我对我的加入号码失败感到沮丧
I had been disheartened by the failure of my join number on

43
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,420
我的第二个加入
And my join number two

44
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,575
大人自己永远无法理解任何事情
Grown ups never understand anything by themselves

45
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:45,310
孩子们总是永远向他们解释事情是令人厌烦的
And it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them

46
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,320
所以后来我选择了另一个专业
So then i chose another professio

47
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,260
并学习驾驶 airplant
And learn to pilot airplants

48
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,417
我飞遍了世界各地
I have flown a little over all parts of the world

49
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:05,975
确实，地理对 m 非常有用
And it is true that geography has been very useful to m

50
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:07,510
一目了然
At a glance

51
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,580
我可以区分中国和亚利松
I can distinguish china from arizon

52
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,650
如果一个人在黑夜迷路
If one gets lost in the night

53
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,570
这些知识很有价值
Such knowledge is valuable

54
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,579
在今生的过程中
In THE COURSE OF THIS LIFE

55
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,620
我遇到过很多次
I have had a great many encounter

56
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,815
与很多人在一起
With A GREAT MANY PEOPLE

57
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:31,882
谁曾关心过重要的事情
Who have been concerned with matters of consequence

58
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:36,340
我在成年人中生活了很多
I have lived a great deal among grown ups

59
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,530
我看到他们近在咫尺
I have seen them immediately close at hand

60
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,810
而这种情况并没有因为堆积而得到太大改善
And that hasn't much improved by piling of them

61
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,320
每当我遇到他们中的一个
Whenever i met one of them

62
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,740
在我看来，谁是完全清楚的
Who seemed to me at all clear sided

63
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,800
我尝试了向他展示我的 1 号加入的实验
I tried the experiment of showing him my join number one

64
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,007
我一直保持着
Which i have always kept

65
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:03,650
我会试着找出答案
I would try to find out

66
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,720
所以，如果这是一个真正有理解力的人
So if this was a person of true understanding

67
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,240
但不管是谁
But whoever it was

68
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,357
他或她总是会说
He or she would always say

69
00:05:18,357 --> 00:05:21,150
那是一顶帽子
That is a hat

70
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,320
那我就永远不会和那个人谈论蟒蛇
Then i would never talk to that person about boa constrictors

71
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,922
或者为邪恶森林或星星
Or prime evil forests or stars

72
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:37,145
我会把自己降低到他的水平
I would bring myself down to his level

73
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:45,335
我会和他谈论桥牌和高尔夫，以及政治和领带
I would talk to him about bridge and golf , and politics and neckties

74
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:51,790
长大后会很高兴遇到这样一个明智的人
And the growing up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man

75
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,920
